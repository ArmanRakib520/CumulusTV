# Privacy Policy for Cumulus TV
Cumulus TV is an open-source app which allows users to create their own channels and stream content from around the web through Android
TV's Live Channels app.

Cumulus TV contains a variety of helpful features which allow users to get the best user experience.

## User Accounts
One of these features is being able to sync your channel data to Google Drive, allowing users to access the same channels on all of their
devices. This is completely optional. Without this, channels can still be created locally. No information about your account or files
are used beyond what is necessary for syncing to function.
